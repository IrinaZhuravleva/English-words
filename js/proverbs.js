  `No, I've never worn a wig. I think that people who wear wigs sound and look ridiculous.
  <br />
  I think they really just do it for attention or to be funny, which isn't funny at all, to be honest`,
  `Well in all fairness, I don't know much about this topic. I'm not from India and I don't know much
  about cooking. But if I had to give an answer, it's very difficult to predict the future,
  but what I would say is maybe AI will change how the restaurants take orders, and how they
  deliver the food to their customers, But that's just a complete guess.`,
  `Well you know, my honetown in Korolev and you might not know this but Korolev is very modern,
so I suppose I sould have to say I like the architecture. Actually, all over the city, 
there are lots of new fascinating structures being built. In fact, it's quite intriguing to consider that when I was younger, 
most of the edifices looked the same, so, you know, it wasn't as appealing as it is nowadays.`,
  `Well as you can probably guess I come from Korolev and I have lived here all my life, alshough at the
moment I'm studying in another city - Moscow. I suppose if I have to describe Moscow, the first
thing I would say is taht it'absolutely enormous, maybe even one of the biggest cities I guess. 
It's so colossal in fact that even the locals have problems finding their way around. Another significant
caracteristic is that if offers examples of both classical and contemporary architecture. Actually
some of the Russia's most renowned landmarks are 'slap-bang' in the middle of Moscow`,
`Well to be quite honest, in general I sould say that I'm actually quite keen on animals,
but in particular I would probably have to say that I'm really into domestic pets like dogs. I guess
the reason why I'm a fan of dogs is because I adore their loyalty and companionship. In addition
to dogs I suppose I'm also pretty passionate about endangered species, especially dolphins
and thing like that and this is due to the fact I feel some degree of responsibility towards
wildlife protection.`,
`Well in general I would say that I'm quite passionate about Italian food, bo be more specific
I would probably say that I'n really into pizza and pasta. This is mainly because my husband
 always cooks Italian cuisine at home.`,
//  Bean curd, also commonly known as tofu, is made from ground, 
// pressed soybeans and has been eaten for over 2,000 years.
 `Well to be quite honest, in general I sould say that I'm actually keen on..., but in particular
  I would probably have to say that I' really into..., you know, things like....I guess the reason
   why I'm a fan of ...is because I adore.... In addition to this I suppose I'm also pretty
    passionate about..., especially... and things like that, and this is due to the fact that ...`,
`As well as this, I'm quite partial to vegetarian food especially things like bean curd. 
This could be because...I'm quite consious of healthy eating and bean curd is a fat-free food and it's 
high in nutritional value.`,
`(what's wrong with your city?) Of course I think I'd have to say that I'm not so keen on the weather. To be more precise, I really
 can't stand the summer months. This is due to the fact that the temperatures can get as high as
  40 degrees so it can be quite uncomfortable if you don't have aire conditioning in your house. 
  In addition to this, I'm not really that fond of the public transport system. And I guess 
  this is probably because the buses are too old and the seats are really hard, so long journeys 
  are usually pretty bumpy.`,
  `Of course, it goes without saying that there's quite a mixed variety of public transport in my city.
   Though I think the most commonly-used would potentially be buses. And the explanation for this could 
   be that they are so cheap and reliable. In gact the average bus fare in my city is about 5o roubles
    for a single journey. As well as buses, a second variety of public transport would be something 
    like taxis. And one exceptional aspect with (taxis) is that they are certainly the quickest way to 
    get around town. So ir you're in a hurry then taxis are the best bet (= the best choice)`,
    `Of course, it goes without saying there's quite an extensive diversity of ...(topic). Still, 
    I suspect that the most + <i>adj</i> could perhaps be...(type 1). And what you have to realise with
     (type 1) is that ....In fact/so/because/but...(detail). Another form of ...(topic) worth mentioning
      could be ...(type 2). And the main characteristic of ...(type 2) is that ...(detail) 
      (+linkin word/complex structure). And naturally, there's things like ....(2-3 other types).`,
    `Well in all fairness, I think I sould have to say that it really depends, Like for instance, if 
    I have the money, than it's quite possible that I will watch a movie in the cinema, one or two
     times a month. You know cinema tickets are pretty pricey in Russia. Whereas in contrast, if I'm 
     broke, it's more likely that i'll watch movies at hone on DVD, you probably know that DVDs
     are quite cheap here, especially compared to the price of a cinema ticket.`,
